Shopify App Boilerplate
=======================

This repo provides a starting point for building a [Shopify embedded application](https://docs.shopify.com/embedded-app-sdk)
with Node and Ember.

Out of the box you get:

- Shop authentication with Shopify OAuth
- Embedded admin application generated by [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com) server with self-signed SSL certificate (allows app iframe to be embedded during dev)
- Authenticated API using [JSON Web Tokens](http://jwt.io/)

Basically, all of the boring things are taken care of so you can focus on the app.
